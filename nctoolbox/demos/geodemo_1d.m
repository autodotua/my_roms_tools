% Method D: Read surface salinity using NJ_TSLICE
% Most compact method for getting data and grid, but limited to 
% entire slices or 3D volumes of data at a particular time step. 

% OPeNDAP Data URL for a CF-Compliant curvilinear ROMS model dataset
url ='http://geoport.whoi.edu/thredds/dodsC/examples/bora_feb.nc';
itime=1;
ilevel=-1; % nj_tslice uses "-1" instead of "end" to indicate last level
[salinity,grd]=nj_tslice(url,'salt',itime,ilevel);


%% Plot with pcolor
% Plotting using pcolor is as simple as the code below. Sometimes
% coordinates are stored in the netcdf datasets as vectors (vs. the 2-d
% arrays that these lat/lon coordinates are in). When this is the case, see
% Matlab's meshgrid function to create 2-d plaid grids from the vectors.

% Remember that pcolor expects a double as input
 pcolor(grd.lon, grd.lat, double(salinity))
 shading flat; colorbar; caxis([35 39]);

% Now let's add a title to the figure that includes the dataset's global
% attribute title and the date of the data that we subset.

 title({nc.attribute('title'); datestr(grd.time)})
